    -Get the data from the user 
    -Ask user to upload the data and immediately run category identification agent and get it verified from the user
    -Then give option to add another data set and repeat above step till user clicks on all ‘tables uploaded and proceed to step2’
    -Ask user about the granularity of the problem statement we want to solve 
    -Product (its mandatory to have product level data in all uploaded tables in this case)
    -or Customer(default)
    
    -Validation
    -At least one billing table is must

        problem_statement_level:product/Customer
        step1_validation:True


Step2 data mapping step
    -Generate mapping suggestion based on uploaded data and its mapping
    -Get it confirmed from the user with constraint of mandatory mapping fields must be mapped as per category 
    -above this for all three category tables
    -Rename the columns with StdCols once confirmed

    -Step2 output
        mappedBillingData,
        mappedUsageData,
        MappedSupportData


Step3 data cleaning 
    -Generate cleaning suggestion for each of the table
    -Let user select, skip or manually instruct about cleaning step
    -Repeat for all three category tables

	Step3 output
        cleanedBillingData,
        cleanedUsageData,
        cleanedSupportData

Step4 data aggregation
    -Based on the problem statement level
    -Generate aggregation method suggestions and display the explanation for the same
    -Let user edit it with constrain of allowed methods per data type and confirm
    -Repeat for all three category tables

	Step4 output
        aggregatedBillingData,
        aggregatedUsageData,
        aggregatedSupportData


Step4 data joining
    -Based on mapped fields
    -Show join health and get it confirmed from the user
