Understand data types from the feature_dtype_dict dictionary: {feature_dtype_dict}\n    - If Dtype is TEXT, suggest aggregation methods from ['Unique Count','Mode','Last Value'].\n    - If Dtype is NUMERICAL, suggest aggregation methods from ['Min','Max','Sum','Mean','Median','Mode','Last Value'].\n    - If Dtype is DATETIME, suggest aggregation methods from ['Max', 'Min'].\n    - If Dtype is BOOLEAN, suggest aggregation methods from ['Mode','Last Value'].\n\n*2. Understand distributions of the numerical fields from describe_dict: {df_describe_dict}, and feature names and their sample values from {sample_data_dict}, and textual descriptions from column_text_describe_dict: {column_text_describe_dict}, and also consider the frequency: {frequency} of the data while suggesting aggregation methods.\n\n**NOTE**\n* Suggest methods like 'Min' or 'Max' when you think aggregating on extremes of the values can be a useful feature.\n* To capture the central tendency of a feature, suggest 'Median' when data is skewed; otherwise, suggest 'Mean' when data is normally distributed.\n* Do not suggest the same set of aggregation methods for every feature.\n* For TEXT data types, suggest 'Last Value' only when aggregating the last value can be useful for model understanding.\n* Consider one feature at a time while suggesting. Avoid suggesting the same set of aggregation methods for features of the same datatype.\n* Provide concise, precise, and assertive explanations in the present tense.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**\n{{\n    \"Feature1\": [\n        {{\"method\": \"Mean\", \"explanation\": \"Explanation for suggesting Mean\"}},\n        {{\"method\": \"Median\", \"explanation\": \"Explanation for suggesting Median\"}}\n    ],\n    \"Feature2\": [\n        {{\"method\": \"Last Value\", \"explanation\": \"Explanation for suggesting Last Value\"}}\n    ]\n}}"
